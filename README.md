# Final_Platformer_2023_10_16_21_24_13
This is a project I made for my CS1 final. It's quite broken and poorly coded but I am still proud of it regardless. If you think you can do better please go ahead just tell me about it and credit me for what i did! Have fun?? I'm not even sure if you can beat it anymore. OH and if the platform is moving way too fast just refresh the page.
